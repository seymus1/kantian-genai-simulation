# kantian-genai-simulation
Monte Carlo simulation of GenAI success scores reinterpreted via Kantian axioms. Tests 10,000 Likert data points across 6 order-theoretic rules (DLO: A1â€“A6). Reveals how finite, discrete data violates density and endpoint-free logic. Frames simulation as epistemological probe of synthetic a priori reasoning.
